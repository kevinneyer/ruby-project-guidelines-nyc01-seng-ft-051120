## MVP's
We wanted our app to fulfill the following functions:
* A user can sign in or sign up as either a teacher or a student.
* Once signed in, a user will be directed to a respective teacher/student prompt directory.
* Using numerical input, a teacher can see their class sessions, students, students' grades, and use a bulletin board.
* Using numerical input, a student can see their class sessions, teachers, grades, and have a study group.
* Both teacher and student models can see all students and view the students with highest grades.
* Once finished, a user can logout of their model, be returned to the home screen, and exit the application.
